From Raw HR Data to a Meaningful Story — My Latest Power BI Dashboard

Today, I’m excited to share a project that helped me understand how numbers can speak when visualized the right way.

Over the past few days, I worked on building an HR Analytics Dashboard using Power BI. What started as a simple dataset transformed into a complete view of workforce insights — helping answer questions that every HR team cares about.

🔍 Key insights from the dashboard:
📌 Total headcount: 50,000+ employees
📌 Gender distribution: Balanced — 25K male & 25K female
📌 Departments analyzed: 6 major teams
📌 Most employee-dense city: Mumbai
📌 Avg performance rating: 2.99
📌 Avg age: 39.9 years
📌 Trend of joinees from 2010 to 2024
📌 Department-wise headcount & performance comparison

Building this dashboard helped me strengthen:
✔ Data cleaning & transformation
✔ DAX measures
✔ Visualization techniques
✔ Business-focused storytelling

What I learned is that HR data is more than numbers — it reflects culture, hiring patterns, diversity, and overall organizational health.

I’m continuously improving my Power BI skills, and this project is another step forward.
Happy to receive feedback or suggestions from the community!
